# IDOL, KeyView and Eduction APIs

IDOL, KeyView and Eduction are designed to be embedded into other services.  Micro Focus IDOL embeds both the KeyView Filter SDK and Eduction SDK into the [Connector Framework Service (CFS)](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_12/CFS_12.12_Documentation/Help/).  Other parts of IDOL also embed KeyView and Eduction SDKs.  Many other Micro Focus products also embed IDOL services, KeyView and Eduction to enhance their capabilities.  ISVs also license IDOL, KeyView and Eduction, embedding them into their applications and services for:
- data loss prevention (DLP) and other security and information governance needs,
- document / content management,
- archiving and eDiscovery,
- and other use cases.
